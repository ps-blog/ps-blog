# Let's build ~form~ validation library in PS

[ ] Describe the overall goal and html forms as a base series example. I have to point out the main properties of this scenario:

  - we should accumulate all the errors
  - we should be able to compose subform validators into a proper form
  - we should be able to render the form / widgets and possible errors
  - we want to be able to serialize value to the form "input"
  - we want to be able to provide default values for fields

[ ] Take a step back and refer the validation library. Should I rewrite "PS Book"? Am I able to provide different description (if so should I start my writing without reading the actual book fragment)?

[ ] Should I include review of `codec` lib? Would it be constructive or necessary? Am I able to say definitive things about limitation of that approach?
